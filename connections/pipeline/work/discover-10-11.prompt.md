# Discovery brief (one set per run)

You map every genuine connection in one *set* of this physics knowledge base. A set is two fields, `A-B`, or one field's *within* links: notes in different subfields of field A. The material for your set is below this brief, already extracted for you:
- the nodes, with one-line summaries;
- explicit cross-links already written in the notes;
- shared curated concepts;
- latent candidate pairs;
- shared papers.

## Steps
1. Work from the material below and your own physics knowledge. Do not run commands or search the folder.
2. Read at most 3 node READMEs (`knowledge/<path>/README.md`), and only where a connection's physics genuinely needs checking. Most runs need none.
3. **Answer** with JSON Lines ONLY: one JSON object per line. No prose, no headings, no code fences. Anything else in your answer is discarded.

## What counts
Include every connection a specialist in either field would recognise as real and non-trivial:
- the same equation or mathematical structure;
- the same mechanism;
- a method, algorithm or instrument that moved across;
- a system both fields study;
- an idea that migrated historically;
- an analogy, with where it breaks.

Exclude generic overlap ("both use differential equations"). Each explicit cross-link in the material becomes a record with `"status": "written"`; everything else is `"new"`. Aim for 12–40 records: dense pairs more, distant pairs fewer, within-field 15–35. Use the most specific nodes (topic over subfield).

## Record schema
`{"a": "<node path, e.g. 08-condensed-matter/superconductivity/bcs-theory-and-conventional-superconductors>", "b": "<node path>", "name": "<≤60 chars>", "kind": "identity|mechanism|analogy|duality|method transfer|shared object|historical", "status": "written|new", "summary": "<1–2 sentences, ≤45 words: what is shared and how it maps>", "map": "<optional LaTeX of the shared equation or symbol map, ≤200 chars; in JSON write a LaTeX backslash twice, e.g. \\Delta>", "breaks": "<where it fails; required for analogy>", "confidence": "established|current research|proposed", "strength": 3|2|1, "sources": []}`

- **Strength:** 3 = deep or structural, 2 = substantial, 1 = suggestive.
- **Sources:** optional, at most 2 per record, only from a README you read, in the format `Author (Year). \"Exact title\". *Venue* vol, page. [doi:…](https://doi.org/…)`. Citations are verified centrally afterwards.
