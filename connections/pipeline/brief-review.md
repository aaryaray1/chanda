# Specialist review brief (one packet per run)

You are the specialist for the branch named above. Below this brief are your branch's notes (the codex sections for every node in the packet) and the packet itself, one proposed connection per line, each with at least one end in your branch. Check every one from **your branch's side**:
- Is the physics right?
- Is the stated kind right (identity, mechanism, analogy, duality, method transfer, shared object, historical)?
- Is the summary accurate, the confidence label honest and the strength fair?
- Are the node paths on your side the most fitting notes?

Work from the notes below and your own knowledge. Do not run commands or search the folder. Read a node README only if the notes below are not enough, and at most 3 of them.

## Answer: JSON Lines ONLY
Give one line per packet record, in packet order. No prose, no headings, no code fences; anything else is discarded.
- `{"id": "C0123", "verdict": "confirm"}` when it is right as written.
- `{"id": "C0123", "verdict": "revise", "reason": "<≤25 words>", "fix": {"summary": "...", "kind": "...", "confidence": "...", "strength": 2, "breaks": "...", "map": "...", "a": "<better path>", "b": "<better path>"}}`. Include only the fields that change.
- `{"id": "C0123", "verdict": "reject", "reason": "<≤25 words: the physics error, or why it is trivial or false>"}`.

After the verdicts you may add up to 8 important connections touching your branch that the packet lacks, as `{"verdict": "add", "record": {"a": "<node path>", "b": "<node path>", "name": "<≤60 chars>", "kind": "...", "summary": "<≤45 words>", "map": "...", "breaks": "<required for analogy>", "confidence": "established|current research|proposed", "strength": 3|2|1, "sources": []}}`.

Be strict but fair. Reject only real errors or trivial links; prefer revise when a connection is real but mis-stated.
